# SampleGitFlow
This repository is to provide an example of how a modern git flow might look mid sprint.

1. An initial commit is made before the pull request is created
2. Once the Pull request is created, all commits are tracked against it.
3. This allows a reviewer to evaluate exactly what work has been completed before merging it back into the main project.
